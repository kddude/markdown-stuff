The progress-line directive accepts three inputs:

* `quote`
* `author`**
* `date`** 
	      
** (optional)

####quote (string)

The quote input is a string of the quote you want displayed. There is currently no limit on its size,
however, it is recomended that if it is large you make the card size medium or larger.


####author (string) - optional

The optional author input is a string of the name of the author of the quote, or any text you wish to display in the author section.  	
 
###date (string) - optional

The optional date input is a string of you wish to display with the quote. **This must be some kind of date string that Angular can accept. **
